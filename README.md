# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Java

This repository contains exercises and solutions from my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at BINUS University. The projects were implemented using Java in the Eclipse IDE and focused on key OOP concepts such as:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**

Each case study presents a different scenario aimed at reinforcing my understanding of OOP principles and enhancing my problem-solving abilities. The solutions provided demonstrate how these concepts are applied in real-world software development.

## Technologies Used:
- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** Eclipse

Feel free to explore the code and examples to see how OOP is used to create flexible and maintainable software designs.
